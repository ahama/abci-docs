## 1.4. Storage Configuration {#storage-configuration}

The ABCI system has large capacity storage for storing the results of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics.
In addition, 1.6TB SSD is installed as local scratch in each compute node.
A list of each file system that can be used in the ABCI system is shown below.

| Usage | Mount point | Capacity | File system | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Home area | /home | 1.0PB | Lustre | |
| Group area 1 | /groups1 | 6.6PB | GPFS | | 
| Group area 2 | /groups2 | 6.6PB |  GPFS | |
| Application area | /apps | 335TB | GPFS | |
| Local scratch area for intaractive node | /local | 12TB/node | XFS | |
| Local scratch area for compute node | /local | 1.5TB/node | XFS | |

## 1.5. System Use Overview {#system-use-overview}

In the ABCI system, all compute nodes, interactive nodes share files through the parallel file system (DDN GRIDScaler).
All users can login to the interactive node as frontend with SSH tunneling.
After login to the interactive node, users can develop/compile/link a program, submit a job, display the status of the job and etc.
Users can develop a program for the compute node on the interactive node not equipped with GPUs.
To run a program on the compute nodes, users submit a batch job and an interactive job to job management system.
A interactive job is typically used for debugging a program, running an interactive application or a visualization application.

!!! warning
    Do not run high load tasks on the interactive node because computing resources such as CPU and memory of the interactive node are shared by many users. To run high load tasks for pre- & post-processing, use the compute nodes.
    Note that if you run high load tasks on the interactive node, the tasks will be forcibly terminated.
